 * Project: Disk Scheduling Simulation
 * Author: Logan Wheat
 * Modification History: 11/17/19 : wrote the code: Logan Wheat
 * struct:
 *point - stores data such as track, sector, and whether it has been accessed or not
 *
 * Procedures:
 *main - driver function of program. Generates random input streams with no duplicates
 *for each experiment, runs each of disk the scheduling algorithms per experiment
 *properly storing the average seek times, and outputs the average seek times
 *calculated over the 1000 experiments for sizes 500-1000 to both standard out
 *and a .csv file to properly generate line graph for report.
 *
 *uniform - uniform random number generator that returns an int between perameters.
 *
 *swap - function to aid bubble sort by swapping points passed by reference.
 *
 *sortRequest - sorts passed request of points utilizing bubble sort (was
 *having issues with qsort).
 *
 *outputRequest - function to output array of points, used mostly for
 *debugging. Not called during main, but kept for useful tool.
 *
 *checkSector - function called to ensure sector value stays in range 0-12000,
 *essentially simulates the disk completing a rotation.
 *
 *fifo - simulates a first in first out disk scheduling algorithm.
 *
 *sstf - simulates a shortest service time first disk scheduling algorithm.
 *
 *scan - simulates a scan disk scheduling algorithm.
 *
 *cscan - simulates a circular scan disk scheduling algorithm.
